##
# The IncludedResourceParams class is responsible for parsing a string containing
# a comma separated list of associated resources to include with a request. See
# http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes for additional details although
# this is not required knowledge for the task at hand.
#
# Our API requires specific inclusion of related resourses - that is we do NOT
# want to support wildcard inclusion (e.g. `foo.*`)
#
# The IncludedResourceParams class has three public methods making up its API.
#
# [included_resources]
#   returns an array of non-wildcard included elements.
# [has_included_resources?]
#   Returns true if our supplied param has included resources, false otherwise.
# [model_includes]
#   returns an array suitable to supply to ActiveRecord's `includes` method
#   (http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#eager-loading-multiple-associations)
#   The included_resources should be transformed as specified in the unit tests
#   included herein.
#
# All three public methods have unit tests written below that must pass. You are
# free to add additional classes/modules as necessary and/or private methods
# within the IncludedResourceParams class.
#
# Feel free to use the Ruby standard libraries available on codepad in your
# solution.
#
# Create your solution as a private fork, and send us the URL.
